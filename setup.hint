ldesc: "App-Info provides a generalized interface for providing 
metadata about software packages installed on a system. The idea is 
that App-Info subclasses can be used in Perl application installers in 
order to determine whether software dependencies have been fulfilled, 
and to get necessary metadata about those software packages."
